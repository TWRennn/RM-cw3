  abstract = {With all the recent attention focused on big data, it is easy to overlook that basic vital statistics remain difficult to obtain in most of the world. What makes this frustrating is that private companies hold potentially useful data, but it is not accessible by the people who can use it to track poverty, reduce disease, or build urban infrastructure. This project set out to test whether we can transform an openly available dataset (Twitter) into a resource for urban planning and development. We test our hypothesis by creating road traffic crash location data, which is scarce in most resource-poor environments but essential for addressing the number one cause of mortality for children over five and young adults. The research project scraped 874,588 traffic related tweets in Nairobi, Kenya, applied a machine learning model to capture the occurrence of a crash, and developed an improved geoparsing algorithm to identify its location. We geolocate 32,991 crash reports in Twitter for 2012-2020 and cluster them into 22,872 unique crashes during this period. For a subset of crashes reported on Twitter, a motorcycle delivery service was dispatched in real-time to verify the crash and its location; the results show 92% accuracy. To our knowledge this is the first geolocated dataset of crashes for the city and allowed us to produce the first crash map for Nairobi. Using a spatial clustering algorithm, we are able to locate portions of the road network (<1%) where 50% of the crashes identified occurred. Even with limitations in the representativeness of the data, the results can provide urban planners with useful information that can be used to target road safety improvements where resources are limited. The work shows how twitter data might be used to create other types of essential data for urban planning in resource poor environments.},

  abstract = {With the increase in the amount and variety of data that are constantly produced, collected, and exchanged between systems, the efficiency and accuracy of solutions/services that use data as input may suffer if an inappropriate or inaccurate technique, method, or tool is chosen to deal with them. This paper presents a global overview of urban data sources and structures used to train machine learning (ML) algorithms integrated into urban planning decision support systems (DSS). It contributes to a common understanding of choosing the right urban data for a given urban planning issue, i.e., their type, source and structure, for more efficient use in training ML models. For the purpose of this study, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of all relevant peer-reviewed studies available in the Scopus database. More precisely, 248 papers were found to be relevant with their further analysis using a text-mining approach to determine (a) the main urban data sources used for ML modeling, (b) the most popular approaches used in relevant urban planning and urban problem-solving studies and their relationship to the type of data source used, and (c) the problems commonly encountered in their use. After classifying them, we identified the strengths and weaknesses of data sources depending on several predefined factors. We found that the data mainly come from two main categories of sources, namely (1) sensors and (2) statistical surveys, including social network data. They can be classified as (a) opportunistic or (b) non-opportunistic depending on the process of data acquisition, collection, and storage. Data sources are closely correlated with their structure and potential urban planning issues to be addressed. Almost all urban data have an indexed structure and, in particular, either attribute tables for statistical survey data and data from simple sensors (e.g., climate and pollution sensors) or vectors, mostly obtained from satellite images after large-scale spatio-temporal analysis. The paper also provides a discussion of the potential opportunities, emerging issues, and challenges that urban data sources face and should overcome to better catalyze intelligent/smart planning. This should contribute to the general understanding of the data, their sources and the challenges to be faced and overcome by those seeking data and integrating them into smart applications and urban-planning processes.},

This paper aims to assess the possibilities of the use of urban big data analytics based on AI-related tools to support the design and planning of cities. To this end, the author introduces a conceptual framework to assess the influence of the emergence of these tools on the design and planning of the cities in the context of urban change. In this paper, the implications of the application of artificial-intelligence-based tools and geo-localised big data, both in solving specific research problems in the field of urban planning and design as well as on planning practice, are discussed. The paper is concluded with both cognitive conclusions and recommendations for planning practice. It is directed towards urban planners interested in the emerging urban big data analytics based on AI-related tools and towards urban theorists working on new methods of describing urban change.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of urban growth is among the most important tasks in urban planning due to their influence on policy decision-making. Specifically, prediction of urban growth at regional levels is crucial for regional policy makers. Making such predictions is difficult because of the existence of complex topological structures and the high-dimensional nature of data sets related to urban growth. Spatial and temporal auto-correlation and cross-correlations, together with regional social and physical covariates, need to be properly accounted for improving the forecasting power of any statistical or machine learning method. To that end, we develop novel machine learning methodologies to perform predictions of urban growth at regional levels by incorporating lead-lag non-linear relationships among past urban changes in each region and its neighbors. Based on this analysis, machine learning algorithms outperform more classical methods, such as a logistic regression, in terms of classifying low/high urban growth regions, and the random forest algorithm seems to have the best prediction accuracy among the selected machine learning methods. Moreover, the random forest method without any external covariates has still a high prediction accuracy which not only confirms that most of variability of urban growth can be described by past observations of self and neighboring changes, but also makes it possible to perform real forecasting of urban growth without accessing any external covariates. The latter makes this modeling framework useful for local policy makers in allocating budget and directing resources appropriately based on such predictions.
  •Machine Learning applications are implemented to land-use change modeling•Non-linear relationships in land developments are incorporated in models•Both contemporaneous and historical dependencies are incorporated in machine learning models•Random Forest model achieves almost 80% accuracy rate using only spatio-temporal lags of the dependent variable.•The block group data is derived using approximately 9 million parcels between 1900 and 2019 for the state of Florida.},

  abstract = {Urban systems involve a multitude of closely intertwined components, which are more measurable than before due to new sensors, data collection, and spatio-temporal analysis methods. Turning these data into knowledge to facilitate planning efforts in addressing current challenges of urban complex systems requires advanced interdisciplinary analysis methods, such as urban informatics or urban data science. Yet, by applying a purely data-driven approach, it is too easy to get lost in the 'forest' of data, and to miss the 'trees' of successful, livable cities that are the ultimate aim of urban planning. This paper assesses how geospatial data, and urban analysis, using a mixed methods approach, can help to better understand urban dynamics and human behavior, and how it can assist planning efforts to improve livability. Based on reviewing state-of-the-art research the paper goes one step further and also addresses the potential as well as limitations of new data sources in urban analytics to get a better overview of the whole 'forest' of these new data sources and analysis methods. The main discussion revolves around the reliability of using big data from social media platforms or sensors, and how information can be extracted from massive amounts of data through novel analysis methods, such as machine learning, for better-informed decision making aiming at urban livability improvement.},

  abstract = {Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperatures (LST) contribute significantly to the formation and intensity of urban heat islands (UHI) effects. The urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) can effectively describe any city's UHI (thermal characteristics) effect. This study aims to assess and predict the seasonal (summer and winter) UTFVI scenario to evaluate the thermal characteristics of Sylhet city, Bangladesh. Landsat 4–5 TM and 8 OLI images from 1995 to 2020 were used to assess the previous status of LULC and UTFVI and predict the future changes for 2025 and 2030 using cellular automata and artificial neural network machine learning algorithms. Prediction results indicate a substantial increase in urban built-up areas by 42% and 44% in 2025 and 2035, followed by reductions in green cover (21% and 22%), bare land (20% and 21%) and water bodies (1%). The rapid expansion of built-up areas will lead to 13 km2 and 14 km2 stronger UTFVI zones in the predicted years. The study provides effective strategies for mitigating the UTFVI effects by avoiding dense infrastructural development, increasing plantation and water bodies, rooftop gardening and using white colour roofs in construction. The findings of this study will allow the urban planners, policymakers and local government to ensure an eco-friendly, inclusive and sustainable urban development through functional modification and replacement of the LULC distribution depending on the present and future circumstances.
  [Display omitted]
  •Directional changes of LULC and seasonal UTFVI shift in Sylhet city were analyzed.•Reduction of green cover significantly increase UTFVI effect.•LULC vs UTFVI relationship better explain impacts of different land cover on thermal environment.•Seasonal UTFVI prediction exhibit a gradual decrease in overall thermal characteristics.•Predicted UTFVI vs LULC demonstrated the highest UTFVI concentration in the built-up area.},

Stratified random samples of the results from an online survey conducted were used for the analysis. The different factors that the residents identified as impacting their willingness to continue living in their neighborhood were defined as the “perception features” and their decision itself was defined as the “liveability feature”. The survey data were then used in an ML classification model, which predicted any user’s liveability feature, given their perception features. ‘Shapley Scores’ were then used to quantify the marginal contribution of the perception features on the liveability metric. From this study, the most important actionable features impacting the liveability of a neighborhood were identified as Safety and Access to the Internet/Organic farm products/healthcare/Public transportation. The main motivation of the study is to offer useful insights and a data-driven framework to the local administration and non-governmental organizations for building more liveable communities.},

  abstract = {The rise of the term ‘big data’ has contributed to recent advances in computational analysis techniques, such as machine learning and more broadly, artificial intelligence, which can extract patterns from large, multi-dimensional datasets. In the field of urban planning, it is pertinent to understand both how such techniques can advance our understanding of cities, and how they can be embedded within transparent and effective digital planning tools, known as planning support systems. This research specifically focuses on two related contributions. First, it investigates the role of planning support systems in supporting a participatory data analytics approach through an iterative process of developing and evaluating a planning support system environment. Second, it investigates how specifically machine learning planning support systems can be co-designed by built environment practitioners and stakeholders in this environment to solve a real planning issue in Sydney, Australia. This paper presents the results of applied research undertaken through the design and implementation of four workshops, involving 57 participants who were involved in a co-design process. The research follows a mixed-methods approach, studying a wide array of measures related to participatory analytics, task load, perceived added value, recordings and observations. The results highlight recommendations regarding the design and evaluation of planning support system environments for co-design and their coupling with machine learning techniques. It was found that consistency and transparency are highly valued and central to the design of a planning support system in this context. General attitudes towards machine learning and artificial intelligence as techniques for planners and developers were positive, as they were seen as both potentially transformative but also as simply another technique to assist with workflows. Some conceptual challenges were encountered driven by practitioners' simultaneous need for concrete scenarios for accurate predictions, paired with a desire for predictions to drive the development of these scenarios. Insights from this work can inform future planning support system evaluation and co-design studies, in particular those aiming to support democracy enhancement, greater inclusion and more efficient resource allocation through a participatory analytics approach.},

  abstract = {Mitigating the adverse impacts caused by increasing flood risks in urban coastal communities requires effective flood prediction for prompt action. Typically, physics‐based 1‐D pipe/2‐D overland flow models are used to simulate urban pluvial flooding. Because these models require significant computational resources and have long run times, they are often unsuitable for real‐time flood prediction at a street scale. This study explores the potential of a machine learning method, Random Forest (RF), to serve as a surrogate model for urban flood predictions. The surrogate model was trained to relate topographic and environmental features to hourly water depths simulated by a high‐resolution 1‐D/2‐D physics‐based model at 16,914 road segments in the coastal city of Norfolk, Virginia, USA. Two training scenarios for the RF model were explored: (i) training on only the most flood‐prone street segments in the study area and (ii) training on all 16,914 street segments in the study area. The RF model yielded high predictive skill, especially for the scenario when the model was trained on only the most flood‐prone streets. The results also showed that the surrogate model reduced the computational run time of the physics‐based model by a factor of 3,000, making real‐time decision support more feasible compared to using the full physics‐based model. We concluded that machine learning surrogate models strategically trained on high‐resolution and high‐fidelity physics‐based models have the potential to significantly advance the ability to support decision making in real‐time flood management within urban communities.
  Key Points
  Surrogate machine learning models were trained for flood prediction using a high‐resolution and high‐fidelity physics‐based model
  The surrogate model accurately emulated flooding depth and duration on streets simulated by the physics‐based model
  A 3,000 times speedup was achieved with the surrogate model compared to the physics‐based model, making it attractive for real‐time decision support},

  abstract = {In order to build a virtual urban planning model and improve the effect of urban planning, this paper builds a virtual urban planning design model based on GIS big data technology and machine learning algorithms, and proposes a solution that combines multiple features. With the development of polarized SAR in the direction of high resolution, a single feature often cannot fully express the detailed information of ground objects, resulting in poor classification results and low accuracy. The combination of multiple features can express feature information well. In addition, this paper uses the ELM method to plan SAR ground object classification, uses an extreme learning machine classification algorithm with fast learning speed and good classification effect, and uses ELM as a classifier. Finally, this paper designs experiments to explore the performance of the model constructed in this paper from two aspects: detection accuracy and planning score. The research results show that the model constructed in this paper meets the expected goals.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the science fields with huge potential to create a cognitive and tech-leaping type of future smart city design/development. However, extant studies lag behind recent applications, potential growth areas, and the challenges associated with AI implementation. This study examines AI’s current role, trend, and future potential impacts in enhancing smart city drivers. The methodology entails conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of publications from 2022 onwards. The approach involves qualitative deductive coding methods, descriptive statistical analysis, and thematic analysis. The findings revealed the impacts of AI in (i) public services and connectivity, (ii) improving accessibility and efficiency, (iii) quality healthcare, (iv) education, and (v) public safety. Likewise, strategies, such as collaborative ecosystems, digital infrastructure, capacity building, and clear guidelines and ethical framework, were proposed for fostering the integration of AI in potential future smart cities. This research fills a notable gap in the current understanding of AI’s specific contributions to smart cities, offering insights for stakeholders in urban planning, computer science, sociology, economics, environmental science, and smart city initiatives. It serves as a strategic guideline and scholarly research output for enhancing smart city design. It also underscores the potential of AI in creating dynamic, sustainable, and efficient urban environments.},
